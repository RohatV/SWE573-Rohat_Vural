Twishper is a website where you can fetch, most recent tweets which includes the query, which you entered. Twishper shows you tweets with their sentiments, the most common 20 words in the fetched tweets and overall sentiment distribution of fetched tweets. If you register and login to the Twishper, Twhisper allows you to save the results. You can find your saved results in the search history section. Here, in the search history page, beside most common words and overall sentiments, you can see the change of sentiments of the tweets which you saved by time.
